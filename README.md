# hello-world
First repository, project 2???

My name is Yesenia Juarez and I am currently a third year general biology major with a minor in psychology and business. This is the first coding class I have ever taken, and it has been a very interesting experience. I like to paint and I dabble with ceramics. I have a 1 year old tuxedo cat named Maka, she's the biggest trouble maker there is.
